# AI-Based-Residential-Security-System
AI Based Residential Security System using Raspberry Pi, Face Recognition, Computer Vision, IoT and other technologies.

The rise of smart homes and the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the development of more advanced home security systems. This project presents an AI-based residential security solution that leverages face detection and recognition to enhance safety and reliability. The system uses a Raspberry Pi as the control unit and integrates sensors and camera technology to provide real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Features
- AI-powered face detection and recognition for secure access control  
- Real-time video monitoring through Raspberry Pi and USB camera  
- Email notifications with captured images for unrecognized faces  
- Motion-based activation using IR sensors to optimize power usage  
- Remote access and cloud-based data storage for continuous monitoring  
- Significant improvement over traditional home security systems  

## Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi 3B+  
- Python, OpenCV  
- Internet of Things (IoT) integration  
- Infrared (IR) sensors  
- Computer Vision & Image Processing  
- Email Notification System
